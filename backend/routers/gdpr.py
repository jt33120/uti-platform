RGPD / GDPR — droit à l'effacement (right to erasure, art. 17 RGPD).

The existing admin "delete account" only removes the profile row and the
Supabase Auth user. Because consultants.created_by and submissions.submitted_by
are declared ON DELETE SET NULL, the personal data carried by those rows
(consultant identity, CV text, CV files in storage, AI matching summaries)
survives account deletion — which is not compliant with a real erasure request.

This endpoint performs a *full* cascade erasure of every piece of personal
data attached to a user, in dependency order, and removes the CV files from
object storage (which no SQL cascade can reach).

Admin only. The PR opening this is the review gate — Julian merges manually.
